**Question 1:** Please assign values to 5 different variables each corresponding to a different simple
data type that exist in the Python language. Please pay attention for the PEP 8 guidelines in 
choosing variable names!

**Question 2:** Please assign variables to the individual components of your favorite gene! (e.g.
promoter, 5' UTR, start codon, exon1, intron, exon2, stop codon, 3' UTR). Print the entire gene 
by using the string concatenation operator, on the standard output! Note: Feel free to create a 
fictional gene sequence by randomly filling in the gene components by the characters 
corresponding to individual nucleotide bases.
